        "description": "Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the environment. Air pollution can be chemical, physical or biological.[1] There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ozone, nitrous oxides, and methane), particulates (such as soot) and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death; it can also cause harm to animals and crops and damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[2] Air pollution can occur naturally or be caused by human activities.[3]",
